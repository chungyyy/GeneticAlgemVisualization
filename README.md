* GeneticAlgemVisualization
* Background and Overview
    * GeneticAlgemVisualization visualizes the traveling salesman problem being run through a genetic algorithm. The algorithm attemps to optimize a route in the TSP using concepts of evolutionary biology. 
    * The algorithm implements three core rules on a predefined population size, namely-- selection, crossover, mutation. In the TSP, we assess which route generated amongst many to be the strongest through a fitness function, implement crossovers to converge the results to an optima, and introduce mutations to diverge from potential local optimas.
* Functionality and MVP Features
    * TBD
* Architecture and Technologies
        * D3.js for visualization and allowing users to plot destination points on a map.
        * webpack for bundling dependencies / developing
    ...
Implementation Timeline
